# MCV - More than a CV

The purpose of the app is to create a portofolio in which you can show your work experience along with your hobbies or other interesting stuff you want to share.:)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## BUGS

[desktop] - At refresh, get current route and set nav item as active - solved
[mobile] - nav items are not colored at click, only when clicked outside the color is applied (mat-icon might be the source of it) - outdated

## TODO

[desktop] - align text when nav is expanded
[mobile] - resize apps from modal, they are too big
